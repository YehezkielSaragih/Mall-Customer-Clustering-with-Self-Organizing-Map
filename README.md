# Mall Customer Clustering with Self Organizing Map

## 📝 Project Overview 
This project applies Self Organizing Map (SOM) for customer clustering in a mall setting. The dataset consists of customer information, specifically **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, to identify distinct customer segments. The clustering results provide insights that can be used to enhance product management and marketing strategies.

## 📊 Clustering Results 
![SOM Clustering Preview](...)
The clustering analysis using SOM resulted in:
- **Silhouette Score:** 0.547866216175858, indicating a well-defined clustering structure.
- **Number of Clusters:** 5.
- The largest cluster contains customers with an **Annual Income between 0.2 and 0.4** and a **Spending Score between 0.4 and 0.6**.
- Based on these results, mall management can prioritize product pricing between **0.4 and 0.6** to target the most significant customer segment.

## 💡 Conclusion
This study confirms that **SOM is an effective technique** for clustering mall customers based on their spending behavior and income levels. With these insights, mall management can make data-driven decisions to improve sales and customer satisfaction.
